# This role will install Consul Servers/Agents in all machines. After that it installs the Registrators.
# There is a group of machines in the corresponding environment inventory called 'consul_servers' where the Consul Servers are installed
# In this way they build up a Consul Cluster
# Other machines that are not in the 'consul_servers' group, have the Consul Agents
# The template 'config.json.j2' will look at the environment inventory to decide to generate a config file for booting a server or an agent
