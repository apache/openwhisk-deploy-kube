# Technical Requirements for OKD/OpenShift

The OKD/OpenShift cluster on which you are deploying OpenWhisk must meet
the following requirements:
* OKD/OpenShift version 4.5 or newer (these instructions were tested on 4.5).
* The ability to create routes to make a Kubernetes service
  available outside of the cluster so you can actually use OpenWhisk.
* Unless you disable persistence (see
  [configurationChoices.md](configurationChoices.md)),
  either your cluster must be configured to support [Dynamic Volume
  Provision](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/dynamic-provisioning/)
  and you must have a DefaultStorageClass admission controller enabled
  or you must manually create any necessary PersistentVolumes when
  deploying the Helm chart.
