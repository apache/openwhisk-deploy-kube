# Technical Requirements for Kubernetes

The Kubernetes cluster on which you are deploying OpenWhisk must meet
the following requirements:
* [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) version 1.10+.
  Our automated testing currently covers Kubernetes versions 1.14, 1.15 and 1.16.
* The ability to create Ingresses to make a Kubernetes service
  available outside of the cluster so you can actually use OpenWhisk.
* Unless you disable persistence (see
  [configurationChoices.md](configurationChoices.md)),
  either your cluster must be configured to support [Dynamic Volume
  Provision](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/dynamic-provisioning/)
  and you must have a DefaultStorageClass admission controller enabled
  or you must manually create any necessary PersistentVolumes when
  deploying the Helm chart.
* Endpoints of Kubernetes services must be able to loopback to
  themselves (the kubelet's `hairpin-mode` must not be `none`).
