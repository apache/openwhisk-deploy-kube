Ingress
-------

Defining a Kubernetes Ingress is what makes the OpenWhisk system you
are going to deploy available outside of your Kubernetes cluster. When
you select an ingress method, you are determining what values to use
for the `whisk.ingress` stanza of your `mycluster.yaml` file that you
will use in the `helm install` command.  You will need to define
values for at least `whisk.ingress.type` and `whisk.ingress.api_host_name`
and `whisk.ingress.api_host_port`.

Unfortunately, the exact details of configuring an Ingress vary across
cloud providers.  The detailed instructions
[below](#possible-ingress-types) describe multiple possible Ingress
configurations.  We welcome contributions from the community to
describe how to configure Ingress for additional cloud providers.

If you are deploying on minikube, use the NodePort instructions below.

# Possible Ingress Types

## NodePort

NodePort is the simplest type of Ingress and is suitable for use with
minikube and single node clusters that do not support more advanced
ingress options.  Deploying a NodePort ingress will expose a port on
each Kubernetes worker node for OpenWhisk's nginx service.
In this Ingress, TLS termination will be handled by OpenWhisk's
`nginx` service and will use self-signed certificates.  You will need
to invoke `wsk` with the `-i` command line argument to bypass
certificate checking.

First,  obtain the IP address of the Kubernetes nodes. If you are
using minikube, use the command
```shell
minikube ip
```
otherwise use
```
kubectl get nodes
```

Next pick an unassigned port (eg 31001) and define mycluster.yaml as
```yaml
whisk:
  ingress:
    type: NodePort
    api_host_name: 192.168.99.100
    api_host_port: 31001

nginx:
  httpsNodePort: 31001
```

## IBM Cloud

### IBM Cloud Lite cluster

The only available ingress method for a Lite cluster is to use a
NodePort (see above). Obtain the Public IP address of the sole worker
node by using the command
 ```
bx cs workers <my-cluster>
 ```
Then define mycluster.yaml as

```yaml
whisk:
  ingress:
    type: NodePort
    api_host_name: YOUR_WORKERS_PUBLIC_IP_ADDR
    api_host_port: 31001

nginx:
  httpsNodePort: 31001
```

### IBM Cloud standard cluster

This type of cluster can support a more advanced ingress style that
does not use self-signed certificates for TLS termination (you can use
`wsk` instead of `wsk -i`).  You will need to determine the values for
<domain> and <ibmtlssecret> for your cluster by running the command
```
bx cs cluster-get <mycluster>
```
The CLI output will look something like
```
bx cs cluster-get <mycluster>
Retrieving cluster <mycluster>...
OK
Name:    <mycluster>
ID:    b9c6b00dc0aa487f97123440b4895f2d
Created:  2017-04-26T19:47:08+0000
State:    normal
Master URL:  https://169.57.40.165:1931
Ingress subdomain:  <domain>
Ingress secret:  <ibmtlssecret>
Workers:  3
```

Now define mycluster.yaml as below (substituting the real values for
`<domain>` and `<ibmtlssecret>`).
```yaml
whisk:
  ingress:
    name: ow-ingress
    api_host_name: <domain>
    api_host_port: 443
    api_host_proto: https
    type: standard
    domain: <domain>
    tls:
      enabled: true
      secretenabled: true
      createsecret: false
      secretname: <ibmtlssecret>
    annotations:
      # A blocking request is held open by the controller for slightly more than 60 seconds
      # before it is responded to with HTTP status code 202 (accepted) and closed.
      # Set to 75s to be on the safe side.
      # See https://console.bluemix.net/docs/containers/cs_annotations.html#proxy-connect-timeout
      # See http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_read_timeout
      ingress.bluemix.net/proxy-read-timeout: "75s"

      # Allow up to 50 MiB body size to support creation of large actions and large
      # parameter sizes.
      # See https://console.bluemix.net/docs/containers/cs_annotations.html#client-max-body-size
      # See http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_max_body_size
      ingress.bluemix.net/client-max-body-size: "size=50m"

      # Add the request_id, generated by nginx, to the request against the controllers. This id will be used as tid there.
      # https://console.bluemix.net/docs/containers/cs_annotations.html#proxy-add-headers
      ingress.bluemix.net/proxy-add-headers: |
        serviceName=controller {
          'X-Request-ID' $request_id;
        }

```

## Google Cloud

### Google Cloud with nginx ingress

This type of installation allows the same benefits as the IBM Cloud standard cluster.
According to your nginx ingress settings you can define a <domain> value of your choice.
You can choose to create a tls secret for that <domain> and provide values for <tlscrt> and <tlskey> in base64.

To generate the values for <tlscrt> and <tlskey> you can use the openssl tool:

```
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout tls.key -x509 -days 365 -out tls.crt
cat tls.key | base64
cat tls.crt | base64
```

Now define mycluster.yaml as below:

```yaml
whisk:
  ingress:
    name: ow-ingress
    api_host_name: <domain>
    api_host_port: 443
    api_host_proto: https
    type: standard
    domain: <domain>
    tls:
      enabled: true
      secretenabled: true
      createsecret: true
      secretname: openwhisk-ingress-tls-secret
      secrettype: kubernetes.io/tls
      crt: <tlscrt>
      key: <tlskey>
    annotations:
      kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
      kubernetes.io/tls-acme: true
      nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: 0
```
