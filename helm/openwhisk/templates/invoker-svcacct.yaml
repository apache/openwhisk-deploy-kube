# When using KubernetesContainerFactory, invoker pods need extensive
# permissions to manage pods and deployments. The ability to create
# pods can enable privilege escalation attacks, so restrict it to a
# ServiceAccount that is only used for the invokers and only defined
# when using KubernetesContainerFactory.
